Overall Lab1 went well. Building the index first with the class names made it easy for me to layout the css. Styling was defintely the harder part about this project. Making something that mimiced the other websites was not easy so I took some of my own creative liberties and mix and matched designs the websites both had while trying to keep the overall same layout. I also did some of my own research as to what are the overall aspects that makes a portfolio website. W3 schools was by far the most useful source I had since it was pretty much able to teach me any concept that I needed to know when creating the site. AI was also useful in providing ideas on how to tackle certain problems, for example, I needed to dim my background image for my hero section and it was able to provide me with the idea of a linear gradient which then led me back to w3 schools on how to use that code. The grids took a little bit to learn as well but with the links you provided I was able to learn how to use them and some what mimic the grid like layout on the https://www.hellerchronicles.com/ landing page.
