      <h1>My Project Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
        A collection of my projects built during my time at SNHU,
        with the goal of creating or working on applications that can make people’s lives just a little bit easier.
        Developed using modern techniques, easy to understand UI, and problem solving skills.

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, I am Dylan Martinelli an aspiring software engineer currently attending Southern New Hampshire University.
            Being in my final year here at SNHU has brought me to start thinking about where I would like to bring my personal skills next.
            I have always found enjoyment in making an impact on the things I am a part of. 
            Whether it’s the projects I work on, the clubs I have been involved with, or the jobs I have held, I bring my skills in problem-solving, management, and a strong work ethic.
            In my free time I enjoy watching Boston sports or doing outdoor activities whether that is golfing, fishing, or hunting.
